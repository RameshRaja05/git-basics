-   Stress is a very complex phenomenon that we can define in several ways. 
    However, if you put them together, it is basically the wear and tear of daily life. 
    Stress management refers to a wide spectrum of techniques and psychotherapies for controlling a person’s stress level, 
    especially chronic stress. 
    If there is effective stress management, 
    we can help one another break the hold of stress on our lives. 
    The essay on stress management will throw light on the very same thing.

-Identifying the Source of Stress
The first step of stress management is identifying the source of stress in your life. It is not as easy as that but it is essential. The true source of stress may not always be evident as we tend to overlook our own stress-inducing thoughts and feelings.

For instance, you might constantly worry about meeting your deadline. But, in reality, maybe your procrastination is what leads to this stress than the actual deadline. In order to identify the source of stress, we must look closely within ourselves.

If you explain away stress as temporary, then it may be a problem. Like if you yourself don’t take a breather from time to time, what is the point? On the other hand, is stress an integral part of your work and you acknowledging it like that?

If you make it a part of your personality, like you label things as crazy or nervous energy, you need to look further. Most importantly, do you blame the stress on people around you or the events surrounding you?

It is essential to take responsibility for the role one plays in creating or maintaining stress. Your stress will remain outside your control if you do not do it.
